    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="content-card">
        <p>
            I am Sandeep B N, a Documentation and Content Strategy expert with over 15 years of experience in technical 
            writing, content development, and information architecture. Throughout my career, I have been passionate about 
            simplifying complex technical concepts to make them accessible to diverse audiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            My professional journey includes leadership roles at renowned organizations such as Wipro, Tech Mahindra, and 
            MindTree. These roles allowed me to lead cross-functional teams, manage large-scale documentation projects, and 
            collaborate with stakeholders to develop user-focused content strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to my corporate experience, I have worked as a freelancer for global clients, delivering custom content 
            solutions tailored to their specific needs. My expertise spans creating scalable content frameworks, building 
            documentation systems, and designing intuitive information architectures that foster engagement and usability.
        </p>

        <p>
            My core focus is on designing content that enhances the user experience. I believe in building structured, user-friendly 
            documentation that supports both technical and non-technical audiences. My goal is to help businesses 
            communicate effectively, deliver valuable information, and create exceptional user experiences.
